# 🏆 CrewAI Hackathon Demo Guide
## Agent Security Gauntlet - Multi-Agent LLM Governance

---

## 🎯 **ELEVATOR PITCH (30 seconds)**

*"We built an Agent Security Gauntlet that uses CrewAI to orchestrate multiple specialized AI agents for real-time security governance. When web agents encounter potentially malicious content, our Adversarial Review Board - powered by 3 LLM jurors with different security perspectives - analyzes threats and makes approval decisions in real-time. This addresses OWASP LLM01 (Prompt Injection) with explainable, multi-agent defense-in-depth."*

## 🎭 **DEMO SCRIPT (Word-for-Word)**

### **Opening (45 seconds)**
*"Hi everyone! I'm excited to show you our Agent Security Gauntlet - a solution to one of the biggest threats facing AI agents today.*

*OWASP lists Prompt Injection as LLM01 - the number one security risk for LLM applications. When web agents browse malicious sites, attackers can inject hidden instructions to hijack the agent's behavior.*

*We solved this with CrewAI by creating an Adversarial Review Board - multiple specialized AI agents that review every action before execution."*

### **Demo Introduction (30 seconds)**
*"Let me show you how it works. Here's our clean interface - notice we have LLMs enabled with 3 jurors ready. Each juror has a different security perspective: strict security, balanced analysis, and red-team expertise.*

*Now let's simulate an attack..."*

### **Attack Demo (90 seconds)**
*"I'm selecting 'trap_hidden_text' - this simulates a malicious website with hidden prompt injection. Watch the console as I run this...*

*[Click Run] See that? Our 3 AI jurors are analyzing the content in real-time:*
- *Strict Security is flagging critical risks*
- *Balanced Analyst is confirming the threat*  
- *Red Team expert is identifying attack patterns*

*Look at the results: Task Success ✅ AND Attack Blocked ✅. The system completed the legitimate task while blocking the malicious content.*

*Here in the juror panel, you can see each AI's risk assessment and reasoning. The LLM Panel defense was activated."*

### **Transparency Demo (60 seconds)**
*"What makes this special is complete transparency. In the LLM Interaction Logs, you can see every prompt sent to our AI jurors and their exact responses. This creates a full audit trail.*

*[Show export] You can download the complete decision log for compliance and analysis.*

*Now watch this - let me try an unknown attack pattern our system has never seen before..."*

### **Unknown Attack (45 seconds)**
*"This 'sr_only' attack uses screen reader techniques to hide malicious instructions. Our system has never seen this specific pattern before...*

*[Run demo] And it still blocks it! The LLM jurors generalize beyond simple regex rules to detect novel attack patterns.*

*This shows the power of multi-agent LLM governance - we're not just matching known patterns, we're using AI reasoning to detect new threats."*

### **Closing (30 seconds)**
*"So in summary: We've built a real-time, multi-agent security governance system using CrewAI. It provides explainable AI security decisions, complete audit trails, and generalizes to unknown attacks.*

*This addresses OWASP LLM01 with a practical, deployable solution that keeps AI agents secure while maintaining transparency. Thank you!"*

- Clean, professional UI that won't embarrass you
- Real-time logging proves LLMs are actually working

### **Audience Engagement**
- Ask: "Who's worried about AI agent security?"
- Emphasize: "This is a real, current threat - not theoretical"
- Show: "Watch the AI jurors work in real-time"
- Highlight: "Complete transparency - no black box decisions"

### **Technical Credibility**
- Reference OWASP standards
- Show actual code/logs during demo
- Mention defense-in-depth principles
- Demonstrate generalization to unknown attacks

### **CrewAI Focus**
- Emphasize multi-agent orchestration
- Show specialized agent roles working together
- Highlight task-based workflow
- Demonstrate complex governance use case

---

## 🚨 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **If Streamlit Won't Start**
```bash
conda activate gauntlet
pip install streamlit --upgrade
streamlit run app.py
```

### **If LLMs Show "Disabled"**
```bash
export ARB_LLM=on
streamlit run app.py
```

### **If Demo Runs Too Fast**
- Add pauses between steps
- Explain what's happening in console
- Let audience read the juror rationales

### **If Questions About Real LLMs**
- "We use mock LLMs for the demo, but it integrates with OpenAI API"
- "The mock responses are based on the same heuristics a real LLM would use"
- "You can see the actual prompts we send in the logs"
